# Voice Task Tracker (React)


1. Create a new Vite React project or place these files in `src/`.
2. Install dependencies:


```bash
npm install
# or
pnpm install
```


3. Run dev server:


```bash
npm run dev
```


Notes:
- The app calls placeholder API endpoints at `http://localhost:8000`.
- Voice flow is simulated; you can wire `POST /voice/transcribe` and `POST /voice/parse` to your backend gateway.
